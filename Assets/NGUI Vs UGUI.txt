What's different:


-Canvas can be placed in world space or screen space

-Button's OnClick can now accept parameters. (1 parameter only?). And can also access functions in components attached to gameObject.

-Can use unity's built-in animation tools to animate button transitions.

-Navigating buttons using keyboard is automatic.

-ugui images can use materials

-ugui has component for masking images
-UI is layered through hierarchy. Canvas has layer ordering property.

-UGUI doesn't have colliders. UI can be interactable through script(?)

-Simplified anchoring. No advanced options for anchoring(?). UI is relative to parent.

-UI pivot can be moved
-NGUI uses atlas maker. UGUI uses sprite packer.



What's not in UGUI:

-No component for making draggable objects

-No localization

-No component for camera scrollview

-no UIWrap for looping scrollview contents

-No cLasses for playing audio and tweens.
